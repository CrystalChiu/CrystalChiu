# A Quick Introduction
I'm a recent UC Irvine graduate (March 2025, B.S. in Computer Science) with a passion for full-stack and backend development. I‚Äôve spent ~2 years as a part-time software developer at UCI‚Äôs Office of IT, working on Laravel + Vue.js web apps. Before I transferred to UCI, I attended Mt. Sac. and worked as a tutor for students with disabilities in the ACCESS Tech Lab, as well as a tech lead for the Google Developer Students Club (GDSC). I'm a fast learner, excited to join a team where I can grow and build impactful tech.
